Lab 3 Specs:

For Part A, your job is simply to create the functionality for the three objects: RAT, REST, and ROB.

We have provided the *.h files, which should remain unmodified.  You should simply fill the desired functions in each *.cpp files and compile the file as an independent object file, using the following command:

g++ -c rat.cpp -o rat.o
g++ -c rest.cpp -o rest.o
g++ -c rob.cpp -o rob.o

Since you have no way of debugging these files just yet, tou will be graded for Part A for simply submitting the cpp files.

2.
    sudo apt-get install cmake # install cmake
    cd /usr/src/gtest
    sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
    sudo make

    # copy or symlink libgtest.a and libgtest_main.a to your /usr/lib folder
    sudo cp *.a /usr/lib

3. Use -lgtest -lgtest_main to link when building
