Lab 3 Specs:
tinyurl.com/ACA-Lab3

For Part A, your job is simply to create the functionality for the three objects: RAT, REST, and ROB.

We have provided the *.h files, which should remain unmodified.  You should simply fill the desired functions in each *.cpp files and compile the file as an independent object file, using the following command:

g++ -c rat.cpp -o rat.o
g++ -c rest.cpp -o rest.o
g++ -c rob.cpp -o rob.o

Since you have no way of debugging these files just yet, tou will be graded for Part A for simply submitting the cpp files.  


To run tests pull the Google Test submodule and build

$ cd tests/googletest/googletest
$ mkdir build
$ mkdir /path/to/install
$ mkdir /path/to/install/include
$ mkdir /path/to/install/lib
$ cd build
$ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -Dgtest_build_samples=ON -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
$ make
$ cp -r ../include/gtest /path/to/install/include/
$ cp lib*.so /path/to/install/lib

To ensure it was installed correctly, create test.cpp with these contents:

    #include <gtest/gtest.h>
    TEST(MathTest, TwoPlusTwoEqualsFour) {
        EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        ::testing::InitGoogleTest( &argc, argv );
        return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
    }

and run with the following commands

$ export GTEST_HOME=/path/to/install/
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GTEST_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ g++ test.cpp -I $GTEST_HOME/include -L $GTEST_HOME/lib -lgtest -lgtest_main -lpthread 

if this compiles and runs, congrats! You're ready to run the tests.
